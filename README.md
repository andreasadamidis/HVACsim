# HVACsim-toolkit

The HVACsim-toolkit is an open-source software, originally developed by the KIOS Research Center for Intelligent Systems and Networks of the University of Cyprus which operates within the Matlab environment, for providing a programming interface for the latest version of EPANET, a hydraulic and quality modeling software created by the US EPA, with Matlab, a high-level technical computing software. The goal of the EPANET Matlab Toolkit is to serve as a common programming framework for research and development in the growing field of smart water networks.

The HVACsim-toolkit features easy to use modeling, simulating and plotting results of HVAC systems using Buidling design projects in Revit.


# Requirements

Matlab


# How to use the Toolkit

Download the folder Download ZIP, set the run path in Matlab within the saved folder, and run RunTests.m. This will execute all the commands which have been implemented in the Class.

Example:



# How to fix/report bugs

To fix a bug Fork the HVACsim Toolkit, Edit the code and make the appropriate change, and then Pull it so that we evaluate it.

Keep in mind that some bugs may exist in the gbXML, in case you are not receiving the expected results.
